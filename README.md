# Portfolio: Development branch

## Description

Simple static portfolio website, hosted via [master branch](https://mrv1k.github.io)

## Project discovery: webpack

Most time was spent learning Webpack and optimizing through it. I must admit, webpack is amazing.

For anyone interested in learning webpack check out [SurviveJS Book](https://survivejs.com/webpack/) The book is just as good as webpack.

### Why not master branch?

It's a user site. "User pages must be built from the master branch."
